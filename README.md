# Aero7-11
Aero 7 theme for Windows 11 23H2+

## Notes
This is made on the default aero.msstyles in Windows 11. This was made and tested on Windows 11 23H2.
>[!TIP]
>Accent color on the borders is very wierd. If OpenGlass is started before the Windhawk mod, the accent color will show. However, if OpenGlass starts (or restarts) after the Windhawk mod is active, the color will not show on borders.
>If you are not using OpenGlass or DWMBlurGlass, disable the Mica or Acrylic effects in MicaForEveryone, and set your accent color to show on title bars and borders in Settings.

If you want the borders, you should go into Windhawk's advanced settings and add dwm.exe to the include list.

NOTICE: These borders use a trick that is not the best quality. A better option has been shown (https://rentry.co/win11-dwm-restoration). I have tried this out myself to make sure it works. It is much better, but there is one issue left to figure out before I switch over to this. It will hopefully fix other border issues that have been found as well.

>[!WARNING]
>I recommend using light app mode and dark Windows mode. This does *NOT* have support for dark app mode. The Windows mode is unaffected, but most taskbar mods work better on dark base than light base.

This is an early screenshot. I should get an updated version at some point, but this shows the theme in action. As you can see, it's not 1:1, and unfortunately due to issues I won't be able to make it 1:1 with my current tool.

## Credits
This is not truly my own theme, I have basically meshed parts of multiple different themes together. The mod is based off of teknixstuff's "Bring Back the Borders!" mod.
