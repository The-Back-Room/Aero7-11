# Aero7-11
Aero 7 theme for Windows 11 23H2+!

Currently supports 22H2 through 23H2. It is untested in 25H2, and DWM mods may be a bit buggy in 24H2.

## Notes

The uDWM patch folder labeled 21H2 will NOT work on 21H2. It should be for 22H2!

If you want some more themes based on this, check out [this link](https://gitlab.com/the-back-room/visual-styles/windows-11/aero7-11/-/tree/main/Themes?ref_type=heads).

This is made on the default aero.msstyles in Windows 11. This was made and tested on Windows 11 23H2 and 24H2.

## Warnings

* I recommend using light app mode and dark Windows mode. This does *NOT* have support for dark app mode. The Windows mode does not matter, but most taskbar mods work better on dark base than light base.

* 24H2 has proven to have issues. If you have updated Windows in the last few months, there is a chance that any DWM modifications could break your system. Please proceed with caution and keep backups when applying mods on 24H2 and 25H2.

>[!WARNING]
>Please note that usage of this theme is at your own risk. I ***cannot*** guaruntee compatibility with updates, and cannot be held responsible for any damages. I work with the Visual Style and pointing to third party tools only. The only mod I have made is the Borders mod in this repository, which is made for 23H2.

>If you modify any system files I ***highly recommend*** keeping a backup of **ALL** instructions and files (both original and new) in a place you could access if your system gets bricked so that you can undo any changes.

Here's the theme in action. As you can see, it's not 1:1, and unfortunately due to issues I won't be able to make it 1:1 with my current tool.

## Credits

This theme is "Open Source" in that it is open for anyone to use and edit. Unfortunatly it's stuck in a binary format, meaning there is no code I can release. I do not place any restrictions or payment on this.

Anyone can create a copy or redistribute this. However, the only stipulation is that it must remain free and that all of the following people must be credited for their contributions to Windows customization:

 - teknixstuff: Created the original "Bring Back the Borders!" mod on Windhawk, based on Ittr's uDWM patches.
 - Zee-Ay (Za9-118): Contibuted the Shellstyle dll, and created the Vista Theme.
 - vaporvance: Created the Shellstyle dll in the original Aero10 theme.
 - Ittr: Created the uDWM.dll patch included.
 - SandTechStuff: Updated instuctions for readability.
 - TheDolphinSlayer: Added the Windows 7 alt tab resources.
 - All Windows 7 Aero theme for Windows 10/11 developers: I took bits from various such themes.

I cannot take credit for this theme, except in a few places. I just took the Windows 7 designs, merged them with the Windows 11 aero.msstyles, then put everything into one place to implement it. I do this with the hope that it will help Windows 11 user looking for a good Windows 7 theme for their system.
