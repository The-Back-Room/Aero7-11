# Aero7-11
Aero 7 theme for Windows 11 23H2+!

Currently supports 22H2 through 24H2. it is untested in 25H2.

Note that this is used at your own risk. I cannot guaruntee compatibility with newer updates immediately.

If you modify any system files please keep a backup of all instructions in a place you could access if your system gets bricked so that you can undo any changes.

## Notes

THE uDWM patch folder labeled 21H2 will NOT work on 21H2. It should be for 22H2!

This is made on the default aero.msstyles in Windows 11. This was made and tested on Windows 11 23H2 and 24H2.
>[!TIP]
>OpenGlass is no longer supported on new versions of 24H2. Microsoft has done some janky stuff, and DWM changes are being added with every update. I don't know what this means for DWMBlurGlass or the future of the theme.
>You can still use OpenGlass on 24H2, but be aware that there are high probabilies of crashes (I myself experienced multiple yesterday) and its not officially supported.
>To be clear, this is in no way the fault of the creator(s) of OpenGlass. This is Microsoft being Microsoft and changing things for the sake of change.

>[!WARNING]
>I recommend using light app mode and dark Windows mode. This does *NOT* have support for dark app mode. The Windows mode does not matter, but most taskbar mods work better on dark base than light base.

Here's the theme in action. As you can see, it's not 1:1, and unfortunately due to issues I won't be able to make it 1:1 with my current tool.

## Credits

This theme is "Open Source" in that it is open for anyone to use and edit. Unfortunatly it's stuck in a binary format, meaning there is no code I can release. I do not place any restrictions or payment on this.

Anyone can create a copy or redistribute this. However, the only stipulation is that it must remain free and that all of the following people must be credited for their contributions to Windows customization:

 - teknixstuff: Created the original "Bring Back the Borders!" mod on Windhawk, based on Ittr's uDWM patches.
 - Zee-Ay (Za9-118): Contibuted the Shellstyle dll, and created the Vista Theme.
 - vaporvance: Created the Shellstyle dll in the original Aero10 theme.
 - Ittr: Created the uDWM.dll patch included.
 - SandTechStuff: Updated instuctions for readability.
 - TheDolphinSlayer: Added the Windows 7 alt tab resources.
 - All Windows 7 Aero theme for Windows 10/11 developers: I took bits from various such themes.

I cannot take credit for this theme, except in a few places. I just took the Windows 7 designs, merged them with the Windows 11 aero.msstyles, then put everything into one place to implement it. I do this with the hope that it will help Windows 11 user looking for a good Windows 7 theme for their system.
