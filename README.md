# Aero7-11
Aero 7 theme for Windows 11 23H2+!

</div>

> [!NOTE]
> Aero7-11 is made using the default `aero.msstyles` in Windows 11. This was made and tested on Windows 11 23H2 and 24H2.
> 
> Aero7-11 supports 22H2 through 23H2. It is untested in 25H2, and DWM mods may be a bit buggy in 24H2.

## Warnings

> [!NOTE]
> I recommend using light app mode and dark Windows mode. This does *NOT* have support for dark app mode. The Windows mode does not matter, but most taskbar mods work better on dark base than light base.
>
> 24H2 has proven to have issues. If you have updated Windows in the last few months, there is a chance that any DWM modifications could break your system. Please proceed with caution and keep backups when applying mods on 24H2 and 25H2.

> [!WARNING]
> Please note that usage of this theme is at your own risk. I ***cannot*** guaruntee compatibility with updates, and cannot be held responsible for any damages. I work with the Visual Style and pointing to third party tools only. The only mod I have made is the Borders mod in this repository, which is made for 23H2.
>
> If you modify any system files I ***highly recommend*** keeping a backup of **ALL** instructions and files (both original and new) in a place you could access if your system gets bricked so that you can undo any changes.

Here's the theme in action. As you can see, it's not 1:1, and unfortunately due to issues I won't be able to make it 1:1 with my current tool.

## Installation
This section assumes you have already patched your system to allow third party themes. If you have not, please refer to guides on how to do so. You will need to use a tool such as UltraUXThemePatcher or SecureUxTheme.

- Download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it to a folder of your choice.
- Copy the contents of the [1 - Theme](./1%20-%20Theme/) folder to `%SYSTEMROOT%\Resources\Themes`.
- Follow the instructions in the [2 - Borders](./%20-%20Borders/) folder to set up the borders using Windhawk and the `Bring Back the Borders!` mod.
- Follow the instructions in the [3 - Glass](./3%20-%20Glass/) folder to set up glass effects.
- (Optional) Open the [4 - (Optional) Extras](./4%20-%20(Optional)%20Extras/) folder to explore additional themes and resources.
- Apply the theme by right-clicking on your desktop, selecting `Personalize`, then navigating to `Themes` and selecting the desired theme.

## Credits

This theme is "Open Source" in that it is open for anyone to use and edit. Unfortunatly it's stuck in a binary format, meaning there is no code I can release. I do not place any restrictions or payment on this.

Anyone can create a copy or redistribute this. However, the only stipulation is that it must remain free and that all of the following people must be credited for their contributions to Windows customization:

- **teknixstuff**: Created the original "Bring Back the Borders!" mod on Windhawk, based on Ittr's uDWM patches.
- **Zee-Ay (Za9-118)**: Contibuted the Shellstyle dll, and created the Vista Theme.
- **vaporvance**: Created the Shellstyle dll in the original Aero10 theme.
- **Ittr**: Created the uDWM.dll patch included.
- **SandTechStuff**: Updated instuctions for readability.
- **TheDolphinSlayer**: Added the Windows 7 alt tab resources.
- **OG Nimbi**: Implemented the Optional Extras folder and updated instructions and formatting across multiple files for readability and ease of management.
- **All Windows 7 Aero theme for Windows 10/11 developers**: I took bits from various such themes.

I cannot take credit for this theme, except in a few places. I just took the Windows 7 designs, merged them with the Windows 11 aero.msstyles, then put everything into one place to implement it. I do this with the hope that it will help Windows 11 user looking for a good Windows 7 theme for their system.
