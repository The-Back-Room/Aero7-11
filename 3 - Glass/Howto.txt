==========HOW TO APPLY GLASS==========

DWMBlurGlass:
Works with either form of borders
1: Install DWMBlurGlass
2: Make sure to go to the symbols tab and download symbols
3: Apply it as normal

OpenGlass with Windhawk mod:
1. Download OpenGlass, install it, and start it up.
2: Set MicaForEveryone in mica or acrylic mode to apply to borders.

OpenGlass with uDWM patch:
1: Install OpenGlass and start it up.
2: Go to Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\DWM in regedit
3: Make sure a DWORD called "GlassOverrideBorder" exists and is set to 1

Note: For OpenGlass users an experimental reg file is available. It is not unstable, it is just that the Aero look still seems a little off. Anyone who can help make it better, anything will help!
