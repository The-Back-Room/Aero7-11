==========HOW TO APPLY GLASS==========

DWMBlurGlass:
Does *not* work with the uDWM patch on 23H2, use the Windhawk mod instead.
	1: Install DWMBlurGlass.
	2: Make sure to go to the symbols tab and download symbols.
	3: Apply it as normal.

OpenGlass:
	1: Optionally Run the AeroDWM.reg file to import its contents into the registry.
	2: Install OpenGlass and start it up.

	If you did not import the registry file:
		3: Go to Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\DWM in regedit
		4: Make sure a DWORD called "GlassOverrideBorder" exists and is set to 1

Note: For OpenGlass users an experimental reg file is available. It is not unstable, it is just that the Aero look still seems a little off. Anyone who can help make it better, anything will help!
