==========How To Apply uDWM Patch==========

*Make a copy of uDWM.dll and save it in a safe space before attempting this method!*

Applying:
	1: Get your OS version (21h2, 22h2, 23h2, or 24h2).
	2: Open command prompt as TrustedInstaller.
		- You can use ExecTI, PSExec, gsudo, or anything else that offers TrustedInstaller privileges.
	3: Switch to "C:\Windows\System32".
	4: *RENAME* "uDWM.dll" to "uDWM.dll.old".
		- *DO NOT DELETE IT!* You will want a backup if something goes wrong!
	5: Copy uDWM.dll from the folder for your version to System32.
	6: Run "taskkill /IM /F dwm.exe & dwm.exe" to restart DWM.


*Something went wrong, there is a black screen, DWM is restarting on loop, etc!*

To fix the issue:
	1: You will need to go into recovery mode. To do this:
		- Press and hold the physical power button to shut it down.
