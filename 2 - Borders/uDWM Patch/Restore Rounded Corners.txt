==========HOW TO RESTORE ROUNDED CORNERS==========

The uDWM patch sets DWM back to the Windows 10 look and feel. This includes square corners.

If you are using DWMBlurGlass, there is currently no solution.

If you are using OpenGlass:
	1: Make sure you are using a theme with rounded corners
	2: In the registry editor, go to Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\DWM
	3: Find the DWORD labeled "RoundRectRadius". If it does not exist, create it.
	4: Set it to 0x5 (5 in Hex, not Decimal)
	5: Restart OpenGlass
