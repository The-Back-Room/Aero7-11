==========HOW TO RESTORE ROUNDED CORNERS==========

The uDWM patch sets DWM back to the Windows 10 look and feel. This includes square corners. Unfortunately, MicaForEveryone's options for rounded corners don't work. Instead, you must use a different method.

1: Go to "sysdm.cpl"
2: Turn go to advanced settings for performance and turn off window shadows
3: Make sure you are using a theme with rounded corners
4: Make sure OpenGlass is installed
5: In regedit, go to Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\DWM
6: Find the DWORD labeled "RoundRectRadius". If it does not exist, create it.
7: Set it to 0x5 (5 in Hex, not Decimal)
8: Restart OpenGlass
