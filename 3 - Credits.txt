Aero7-11 by LittleFox

This theme is "Open Source" in that it is open for anyone to use and edit. I do not place any restrictions or payment on this.

Anyone can create a copy or redistribute this. However, the only stipulation is that it must remain free and that all of the following people must be credited for their contributions to Windows customization:

 - teknixstuff: Created the original "Bring Back the Borders!" mod on Windhawk
 - Zee-Ay (Za9-118): Contibuted the Shellstyle dll
 - Ittr: Created the uDWM.dll patch included
 - All Windows 7 Aero theme for Windows 10/11 developers: I took bits from various such themes

I cannot take credit for this theme, except in a few very places. I just took the Windows 7 designs, merged them with the Windows 11 aero.msstyles, then put everything into one place to implement it. I do this with the hope that it will help Windows 11 user looking for a good Windows 7 theme for their system.
