==========THEME==========
1: Copy everything from the included Theme folder to "C:\Windows\Resources\Themes".
2. Use SecureUXTheme, UltraUXThemePatcher, or the UxTheme Hook Windhawk mod to apply the theme.

WHICH THEME DO I USE?
That depends your preferences:
 - Small title bar buttons will allow smaller buttons, but will look extra small when maximized.
 - Square corners will have square border corners.

Note that the Windows 7 alt tab menu is now available with aero7-11 round. The Vista theme is also available.

==========BORDERS==========
You have two options for borders:
1: Windhawk Mod
 - This is easier/safer to apply as you are not manually editing system files
 - However, it is a lower quality mod
 - Instructions are in "Border" folder under "WindhawkHowTo.txt"
2: uDWM Patch
 - This is harder to apply as you must manually apply the file
 - When applied, it is higher quality, and less likely to bug out
 - Instructions are in "Border\uDWM Patch" folder

==========GLASS==========

This has the most options: DWMBlurGlass, OpenGlass, and MicaForEveryone.

DWMBlurGlass is the most compatible with Windows 11, having Windows 7 caption sizes and glow built in.
OpenGlass is more stable but lacks these features.
MicaForEveryone does not provide accurate Aero effects, use it only as a last resort.
