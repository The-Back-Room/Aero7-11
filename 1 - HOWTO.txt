==========THEME==========
1: Copy everything from the included Theme folder to C:\Windows\Resources\Themes
2. Use SecureUX ThemeTool or UltraUX Theme Patcher to apply the theme

WHICH THEME DO I USE?
That depends on the borders and your preferences
 - I recommend using square if you are using the Windhawk mod, and round if you are using uDWM patch
   - If you are not applying borders, either will work
 - Small title bar buttons will allow smaller buttons, but will look extra small when maximized

==========BORDERS==========
You have two options for borders:
1: Windhawk Mod
 - This is easier/safer to apply as you are not manually editing system files
 - However, it is a lower quality mod
 - Instructions are in "Border\Windhawk Mod" folder
2: uDWM Patch
 - This is harder to apply as you must manually apply the file
 - When applied, it is higher quality, and less likely to bug out
 - Instructions are in "Border\uDWM Patch" folder

==========GLASS==========
This has the most options: DWMBlurGlass, OpenGlass, and MicaForEveryone
I had better luck with DWMBlurGlass + MicaForEveryone with the Windhawk mod
However, with the uDWM patch OpenGlass on its own works well
