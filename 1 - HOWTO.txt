==========THEME==========
1: Copy everything from the included Theme folder to "C:\Windows\Resources\Themes".
2. Use SecureUXTheme, UltraUXThemePatcher, or the UxTheme Hook Windhawk mod to apply the theme.

WHICH THEME DO I USE?
That depends your preferences:
 - Small title bar buttons will allow smaller buttons, but will look extra small when maximized.
 - Square corners will have square border corners.

Note that the Windows 7 alt tab menu is now available with aero7-11 round. The Vista theme is also available.

==========BORDERS==========
 - This is required for DWMBlurGlass and MicaForEveryone only
 - Instructions are in "Border" folder under "WindhawkHowTo.txt"

==========GLASS==========

This has the most options: DWMBlurGlass, OpenGlass, and MicaForEveryone.

DWMBlurGlass is the most compatible with Windows 11.
OpenGlass is faster and has more features, but can be broken by newer revisions of Windows 11.
MicaForEveryone does not provide accurate Aero effects, use it only as a last resort.
