==========I'VE APPLIED THIS THEME, WHAT NOW?==========

This theme pack only tries to change the colors, transparency, and in a few cases shape of existing items. It does NOT attempt to change the layout of any existing items. You can of course go on with just the theme as is if this is all you want. But if you want a more immersive Windows Aero look, here are some places you can start after this:

1: ExplorerPatcher: If you want to do anything fixing File Explorer and the Taskbar, this is a great place to start

2: OldNewExplorer: This can help get some Aero/Windows 7 options back in FileExplorer

3: OpenShell: Free start menu option.

4: StartIsBack++: This works well with ExplorerPatcher, at least it did in 23H2. I highly recommend NOT using StartAllBack, as it will mess up the File Explorer theme. It is paid, although easy to get an infinite trial if need be. But if you can, pay and support the creator, please.

5: Winaerotweaker.com: This includes installers for the Windows 7 version of some windows programs.
